# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

This project analyzes 12 months of Cyclistic bike-share data to compare usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. The goal is to provide actionable insights to help convert casual riders into annual members and support business growth.

## Project Structure

- `Cyclistic_Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook with full analysis, visualizations, and recommendations
- `analysis/`
  - `cyclistic_analysis.py` — Python script for data simulation, analysis, and chart generation
  - `cyclistic_analysis.R` — R script for data simulation and analysis (optional)
- `data/`
  - CSV summary files (e.g., `cyclistic_summary_stats.csv`, `cyclistic_day_of_week_stats.csv`, etc.)
- `charts/`
  - PNG images of key charts
- `presentation/`
  - `Cyclistic_Bike_Share_Analysis.pptx` — PowerPoint summary presentation

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo and open `Cyclistic_Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab.
2. Run all cells to generate summary tables and charts.
3. Review the results in the notebook, or explore the `data/` and `charts/` folders for outputs.
4. For script-based analysis, run `analysis/cyclistic_analysis.py` or `analysis/cyclistic_analysis.R`.

## Key Findings

- **Ride Duration:** Casual riders take longer trips on average than members.
- **Weekly Patterns:** Members ride consistently throughout the week; casual riders peak on weekends.
- **Daily Patterns:** Members ride more during commute hours; casual riders ride more midday.
- **Seasonality:** Both groups ride more in summer, but casual ridership is more seasonal.
- **Bike Type:** Both prefer classic bikes, but casual riders use electric bikes more.

## Recommendations

- Target casual riders on weekends with membership promotions.
- Highlight cost savings for frequent riders who convert to members.
- Promote electric bike benefits in membership packages.
- Develop digital campaigns for midday and weekend casual riders.

## Business Impact

By understanding and targeting the unique behaviors of casual riders, Cyclistic can design more effective marketing strategies, increase annual memberships, and drive sustainable growth.
