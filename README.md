# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

This project analyzes 12 months of Cyclistic bike-share data to compare usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. The goal is to provide actionable insights to help convert casual riders into annual members.

## Project Structure

- `analysis/`
  - `cyclistic_analysis.R` â€” R script for data analysis and visualization
- `data/`
  - CSV summary files (e.g., `cyclistic_summary_stats.csv`)
- `charts/`
  - PNG images of key charts
- `presentation/`
  - PowerPoint summary presentation

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo and open `analysis/cyclistic_analysis.R` in RStudio.
2. Run the script to generate summary tables and charts.
3. Review the results in the `data/` and `charts/` folders.

## Key Findings
